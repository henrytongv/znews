# Plan Skill

Create detailed implementation plans for new features and changes.

## Purpose

This skill guides the planning process for implementing new features, fixing bugs, or making architectural changes to the ZNews application.

## Process

### 1. Analyze Requirements

- Understand the feature or change request
- Identify affected components and files
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Review existing patterns in the codebase

### 2. Explore Codebase

- Read relevant files to understand current implementation
- Identify reusable components and utilities
- Check for similar features or patterns
- Review API integrations and data flow

### 3. Design Solution

- Break down the feature into smaller tasks
- Identify files to create or modify
- Plan component hierarchy and data flow
- Consider accessibility and responsive design
- Design error handling and loading states

### 4. Consider Trade-offs

- Performance implications
- Maintainability and code organization
- User experience impact
- Testing requirements
- Deployment considerations

### 5. Create Implementation Plan

Document the plan with:
- **Context**: Why this change is needed
- **Approach**: High-level solution description
- **Steps**: Detailed implementation steps
- **Files**: List of files to modify or create
- **Testing**: How to verify the implementation
- **Risks**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies

## Output

A comprehensive plan document that can be followed during implementation, including:
- Clear step-by-step instructions
- Code examples or pseudocode where helpful
- Testing and verification steps
- Rollback strategy if needed
